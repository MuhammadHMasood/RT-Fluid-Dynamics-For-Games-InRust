# RT-Fluid-Dynamics-For-Games-InRust

This is a reimplimentation of the paper 'Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games' by Jos Stam, except I made it in rust 

I'm using the piston rust package for rendering right now, although I may change it later.

It is a bit messy right now but I'm pretty sure the backend logic is working at least.

Press the left mouse button in order to add density and the right mouse button to remove density.

to build it just git clone the repo and type 'cargo run' inside the folder (make sure you have rust installed first: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
